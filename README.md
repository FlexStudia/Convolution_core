# About

This is the core code for calculating **convolution of a spectrum**.

The process of convolution consistes in reducing the resolution of the original high-resolution spectrum so that it corresponds to an instrument with lower resolution, while preserving the energy as much as possible. 

# How it works

The programme is written in **Python**. 

There is a version with an interface in PyQt framework. You can find it in [the corresponding repository](https://github.com/FlexStudia/Convolution).

There are several possibilities for working with this code:

- use this code to convolve the spectra (to do this you need to install Python, install a virtual environment, install the packages from requirements.txt and then work with the code).
- use this code as a module in your project
